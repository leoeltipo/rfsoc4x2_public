    "# VNA Instrument\n",
    "This example notebooks shows how to use the Analysis and Syntheis Polyphase Filter Banks in conjuction to get the frequency response of a system connected between the DAC-ADC. To have some fun, I'm just using the programmable filter that is part of the firmware.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook I'm using this configuration:\n",
    "* DAC_B -> ADC_C (pfbs) DAC_A -> ADC_D\n",
    "* ADC_C/DAC_A: filter with cascaded PFBs\n",
    "* ADC_D/DAC_B: VNA instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dual DDS and PFBs\n",
    "For this application, the dual-dds comes in handy. As I said before, the second stage channelizer is implemented by using a DDS per channel and a mixer. The same DDS is fed into the Synthesis PFB, same channel. For a VNA application, what is needed is to inject a single tone into the DUT and read its output. This is easy to achieve in this structure, because the DDS is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application sets the same mixer frequency for both the ADC and DAC. Then, when a certain frequency is set in one of the channels of the Synthesis PFB, that will excite the exact same channel on the Analysis PFB. The down-conversion will bring the signal on that channel perfectly to DC. Extra decimation can then be used to lower the noise and improve the quality of the measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase matters\n",
    "It's easy to compute the amplitude response of a system by sweeping the frequency. However, it's not that easy to get the phase response. The design used here, which shares the DDS between both Analysis and Synthesis PFBs, allows to get the phase response of the DUT as a result of the same reference being used on both sides. This demo notebook shows how to calibrate the overall delay of the Analysis/Synthesis structures and then extend the frequency sweep range in order to get a nice phase calibration that may allow to compute delay in the order of ns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase calibration\n",
    "Examples cells are provided to run the phase calibration. The process works as follows.\n",
    "* Coarse delay is estimated for correction. Most of this delay is coming from the digital path.\n",
    "* Once coarse delay is estimated, the frequency sweep range is increased.\n",
    "* The slope of phase vs frequency is used to compute fine delay estimation.\n",
    "* When sweep range is long enough, neighbor PFB channels are crossed and extra phase jumps show up.\n",
    "* These phase jumps are fixed and can be calibrated out.\n",
    "Run the cells in order, specially for the phase calibration cells, in order to get correct results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Play with it!!!\n",
    "Once calibration is done, grab a cable and add that into your connection. You should see very clearly that now the phase response has that extra delay added. If the frequency range is large enough (50-80 MHz), you should be able to estimate delay in the order of ns with no problem."
