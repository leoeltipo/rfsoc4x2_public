This block integrates Xilinx's SSR FFT, generated with Syetem Generator.

The top level also includes the framing block, which aligns the data with
the input TLAST to ensure data is properly aligned.

NOTE: This implementation does not use pkt_align block, which allows to
buffer packets in the case tvalid drops in the middle of a frame. This 
simplified implementation will just discard samples and re-sync again.
