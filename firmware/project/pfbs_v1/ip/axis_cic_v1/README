This block integrates the TDM-muxed 3rd order CIC.

Input data is fixed to 16-bit for I and 16-bit for Q.
Multi-lane expects IQ to be interleaved between channels.

Q[L-1] I[L-1] .. Q[1] I[1] Q[0] I[0].

Given the input width and CIC characteristics, the output
data width is 40-bit for I and 40-bit for Q on the CIC filter.
There is a Quantization Block that converts back tto 16-bit
for I and 16-bit for Q.

NOTE: the block is to be connected to a "always valid" data
stream. As such, it is not possible to drop s_axis_tvalid
as the block won't use this to stop the processing. At the
output, however, m_axis_tvalid should be used as the block
performs decimation and then only a portion of the packets
will be valid. Framing is done by using s_axis_tlast for 
sync. Output m_axis_tlast is honored, too. Finally, back
pressure is not possible by using m_axis_tready.
